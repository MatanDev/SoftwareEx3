/**
 * SP Bounded Priority Queue summary
 *
 * Implements a Priority Queue type.
 * The queue size is limited by an integer called capacity.
 * The elements of the queue are stored in a SPList type, while keeping
 * the invariant of - the list is ordered (first item is smallest)
 * The queue supports storing similar items, and as the
 * enqueue action copy's the content of the given item, the internal order of identical items is not relevant
 * The type also stores a pointer to the last element in the queue, which is also the largest one
 * if the queue is empty, the pointer is NULL
 *
 * The following functions are available:
 *
 *   spBPQueueCreate            - Creates a new empty queue, limited to the given maximum size
 *   spBPQueueDestroy           - Deletes an existing queue and frees all resources
 *   spBPQueueCopy              - Copies an existing queue, with the same capacity
 *   spBPQueueClear             - Removes all the elements from the queue
 *   spBPQueueSize              - Returns the size of a given queue
 *   spBPQueueGetMaxSize        - Returns the maximum size limit (capacity) of the given queue
 *   spBPQueueEnqueue           - Inserts a new item to the queue, the inserted item is a copy of the given one,
 *                                the item would not be inserted if it is larger than the maximum
 *                                item of the queue, and the queue is at full capacity
 *   spBPQueueDequeue           - Removes the minimal item from the queue
 *   spBPQueuePeek              - Returns a copy of the minimal item in the queue
 *   spBPQueuePeekLast          - Returns a copy of the maximal item in the queue
 *   spBPQueueMinValue          - Returns the value of the minimal item in the queue
 *   spBPQueueMaxValue          - Returns the value of the maximal item in the queue
 *   spBPQueueIsEmpty           - Returns true if and only if the queue is empty
 *   spBPQueueIsFull            - Returns true if and only if the queue is full
